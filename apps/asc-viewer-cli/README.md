# Atomic State Canvas Viewer CLI

An interactive web application for analyzing and visualizing atomic state relationships. By launching the development tool, it looks for ".asc." files in the directory and automatically populates the atomic graphs in a "Storybook"-like experience.

## Installation
```bash
npm install @atomic-state-canvas/asc-viewer-cli -D

# Start the viewer
npx asc-viewer-cli
```
